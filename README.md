# OnBoard

OnBoard is an all-in-one platform that incorporates all Healthcare Professionals involved in a patient's journey in the hospital.
With this web/mobile app, healthcare professionals will log in at the start of their shift or during their daily meeting to assign and delegate tasks for the day.
Throughout the day, as tasks are completed, they can be checked off or additional tasks can be assigned.
